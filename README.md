# Stenotype Storyboard Video Player

Designed a video player as part of a Design Engineering proposal to introduce Stenotype - a user-friendly note-taking platform inspired by the open-source Django project, Firepad. The aim is to make Stenotype even better, offering new features and an appealing UI. Stenotype, a device-based note-taking platform, is envisioned to be built on the Firepad, with the vision to replace traditional school notebooks with a modern, cutting-edge solution.
